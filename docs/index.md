# Welcome to BARAM Page

## CFD for Everyone and Everywhere!!

BARAM is a Free Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package. BARAM is developed to mitigate the steep learning curve of Text-based Solvers. BARAM helps you focus on a problem itself with intuitive graphical user interface. For now, OpenFOAM® solvers modified by NEXTFOAM are integrated into BARAM. NEXTFOAM develops and releases it under GNU Public License (GPL).

“BARAM” (pronounced like ‘baa-laam’) is a Korean word that means “wind”.

BARAM package has two applications, BaramFlow and BaramMesh. BaramMesh generates mesh for calculation, and BaramFlow calculates fluid dynamics with that mesh.
